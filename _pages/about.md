I'm the most new computer scientist and computer vision enthusiastic.

I discovered the field of computer graphics during the last year of my CS major. 
Since then, I've been incredibly excited about this area and have developed a 
strong passion to delve deeper into this fascinating topic. Spatial intelligence 
blows my mind —it's like magic, ops, mathematics!

Throughout my undergrad, I participated of Programming Contests like [ICPC](https://icpc.global/).
Although, I didn't accomplish my goal of reaching the international phase of 
the competition, I am very grateful for the path my brilliant partners and I
have traced during this journey, as it allowed us to challenge ourselves, 
improve in Data Structures and Algorithms and learn how to work as a team.
